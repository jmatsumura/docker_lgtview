# docker_lgtview

This repository is now bundled under the https://github.com/jmatsumura/LGTHGT repository
which will eventually hold both the components for LGTView as well as LGTSeek.

This repository houses multiple Dockerfiles that can be used to build an example 
and ultimately customizable instance of LGTview. This pulls the source LGTView code from 
https://github.com/jmatsumura/lgtview

There will be multiple containers/images spanning the various components of LGTview that
must be combined using docker-compose and the docker-compose.yml file. Below is a 
brief rundown with more details to be found in the comments of the docker-compose.yml
file. 

Both DBs, (MongoDB for LGTview & MySQL for TwinBLAST), are more simply imported 
as preset images from Docker hub. 

Containers:

./LGTview - Houses Apache and ExtJS along with the following pieces of code that comprise 
all the functionality present in LGTview:

	- TwinBLAST - contains the scripts for the TwinBLAST interface that is reached through 
	LGTview

	- krona - houses code to generate the interactive krona plots for the main interface
	of LGTview

Images: 

MySQL
MongoDB

# TO BE ADDED WITH FUTURE UPDATES
Additional repos to be incorporated:

* Circleator - this code houses the scripts necessary to run and generate circular
plots of genome-associated data

Images: 

* R - the R statistical software package is contained here to aid in the generation
of graphics like a heatmap
